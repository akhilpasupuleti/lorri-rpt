You are analyzing headers and sample rows from a logistics Excel file. Your task is to strictly map the following required fields:

- "origin_name" (Origin column: city, district, location)
- "destination_name" (Destination column)
- "truck_type" (Truck type or vehicle category)
- "date_column" (Date of movement, preferably in yyyy-mm-dd format)

### Rules:
- DO NOT GUESS.
- If a column cannot be confidently identified, do not assign it.
- Return JSON with two keys:
  - "mapping": an object mapping the identified fields
  - "missing_fields": a list of keys that could not be confidently identified

### JSON response structure:
```json
{
  "mapping": {
    "origin_name": "Header1",
    "destination_name": "Header2"
  },
  "missing_fields": ["truck_type", "date_column"]
}
```

Now process the following:
Headers: {{headers}}
Sample Rows: {{sample_rows}}
